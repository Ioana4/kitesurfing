						<h3>Module 1 - Discovery</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="description">
						<p>At this level you will learn and practice various skills on
							land that will transfer to the water for the next level. The
							skills covered include assessing the physical location and the
							wind window, using safety systems, managing proper equipment
							set-up, and piloting the trainer kite.</p>
						<p>Anyone can complete this level, provided they meet the
							health requirements.</p>
						<h4>Location</h4>
						<p>Almost all accidents occur on land, so before going out,
							you have to chose a safe place to launch and land the kite. Keep
							in mind the wind conditions (straight, directions and stability)
							and the physical layout of the spot (potential obstacles,
							presence of secure area to operate the kite). Assess hazards in
							the area - both in and off the water. Identify the obstacles that
							may affect the quality of the wind. Never practice alone and do
							not venture further than you comfortably swim back.</p>

					<h4>Wind</h4>
					<p>It is important to know the strength and the direction of
						the wind to ensure you use the right kite size. The speed meter
						and local forecast will help you taking the right decision.</p>
					<p>Wind Directions:</p>
					<p>On Shore - Wind coming from the water to the land square to
						the beach</p>
					<p>Off Shore - Wind coming from the land to the water square to
						the beach</p>
					<p>Side Shore - Wind blowing from the sea towards the land,
						slightly side on or side off</p>
					<p>Side On Shore - Wind blowing from the sea towards the land,
						slightly side on</p>
					<p>Side Off Shore - Wind blowing from the land to the sea,
						slightly side off</p>
					<p>Side Shore and side on shore are the safest wind directions
						for kiteboarding</p>
					<h4>Wind Effects</h4>
					<p>Obstacles can have a big effect on the wind, changing the
						flow enough to alter its direction or create turbulence. These
						effects can take place upwind, downwind or close to these
						obstacles.</p>
					<p>Take great care never to let you kite fly into these areas.</p>

					<h4>Weather</h4>
					<p>Before you kiteboard get a local forecast for the day and
						have the right equipment for the condition. Learn about the
						weather signs that you can see around you.</p>
					<p>The clouds are one of the best weather indicators around
						you. High-level clouds are cirrus clouds indicate that you are in
						a warm front or that one is approaching. This should mean stable
						weather and stable wind. If the clouds become fully established,
						then they will move into the midlevel and start to blanket out the
						sky. This could mean a grey and wet day if these clouds are dark
						and full of moisture.</p>
					<p>The clouds forming at the low levels (cumulus) can be very
						messy and it means that you are in a cold front or that there is
						one approaching. The wind is mostly unstable and could lead to
						gusty wind conditions or sudden changes as heavy rain showers.</p>
					<p>A cold front will start with low-level cumulus clouds that
						may then build up into the midlevel as the front establishes
						itself. This can lead to potentially stormy conditions, in certain
						cases to the formation of the cumulonimbus. This is characterized
						by its vertically developed shape and glaciated top that can
						extend to great heights of up to 12 km. As a cumulonimbus
						approaches, you will notice an increase in gusty winds and you may
						also feel the temperature drop. Usually once it has passed, the
						wind drops completely and the cloud disappears.</p>
					<p>If the sky is black, chances are the weather is going to
						change and there is going to be a storm. In this case land you
						kite and wait until the clouds have gone. This type of cloud can
						also signal the start of an electrical storm. The kite lines make
						an excellent conductors for lightning! Pack the kite away!</p>
					<p>Sea Breeze is a thermal wind, created by the sun heating the
						land, which in turn heats the air above. This warm air rises,
						creating a depression over the land. When this happens next to a
						body of cold water, the colder air from the sea moves in to fill
						the gap created by the rising warm air, which we feel as an
						on-shore wind. Sea breezes are generally very steady on-shore or
						cross-on-shore winds and can be great for kiteboarding. At the
						night, as the temperature drops, the whole process happens in
						reverse and the wind blows off shore (land breeze).</p>

					<h4>Right of Way</h4>
					<p>This is a long established sailing rule that applies to all
						forms of sailing, including kiteboarding. Respecting a few
						priority rules helps prevent accidents on the beach and on the
						water.</p>
					<p>The rider entering the water from the beach has the right of
						way over the incoming rider.</p>
					<p>Starboard rider has priority over oncoming rider and should
						keep the course and pass upwind with the kite higher.</p>
					<p>If you passing upwind, bring the kite UP. If you are passing
						downwind, bring your kite DOWN.</p>
					<p>When two riders are traveling in the same direction, the
						faster rider coming up from behind must give way to the slower
						rider in front.</p>
					<p>The rider surfing a wave has priority over the one who is
						jumping or going in the opposite direction</p>
					<p>Right of way must be given to other ocean and beach users.
						Kiteboarders must travel downwind to them.</p>
					<p>To jump, a rider must have a clear safety zone of 50m
						downwind and 30 m upwind.</p>
					<h4>Trainer kite</h4>
					<p>In a IKO kiteboarding course, your instructor will begin
						your training by teaching you to fly a trainer kite and a small
						inflatable kite without power, on a short lines. You will learn
						how to master the basics first before taking on additional power
						with long lines. Your instructor will teach you to set up the
						equipment correctly, launch and land, use the safety systems, and
						perfect all of the basic flying skills you need to know at this
						stage.</p>
					<p>Once you have learned the basics of flying a kite, you must
						to know how to stop the kite quickly in case of an emergency.</p>

					<h4>Set up and carrying the kite</h4>
					<p>The 2 lines located in the middle of the bar (front lines)
						must be connected to the leading edge bridle. These are the power
						lines. The other 2 lines located at the end of the bar (back
						lines) must be connected to the trailing edge bridle. These are
						the steering lines. Remember the phrase: Steer to the Rear .</p>
					<p>There are two ways to set up your kite, with the bar and
						lines upwind and downwind, but all the time the colors have to
						match. Do not launch the kite with the bar inverted or crossed
						lines.</p>
					<p>Handling the kite properly is essential to your safety and
						to those around you. You will learn how to set up an inflatable
						kite with 2, 4 or 5 lines and its safety systems.</p>


					<h4>Safety System</h4>
					<p>You must let go of the bar and pull the quick release in any
						dangerous situation including:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Any time you lose control of your kite</li>
						<li>Whenever here is too much power</li>
						<li>If you are being dragged</li>
						<li>If you crash into another kite or object</li>
						<li>If you are going to crash into something or someone</li>
					</ul>

					<h4>International Kiteboarding Signs</h4>
					<p>Your instructor will use these signs to guide you when voice
						cannot be heard. Learning these signs and using them with other
						riders will allow you to use a common language and help avoid
						misinterpretation.</p>
					<p>��� Ok to launch���, ��� Land my kite���, ���Kite at top of
						the window���, ���Superman position���, ���Let go the bar���,
						���Release the chicken loop���, ���Help��� are some of the signs
						you will learn.</p>

					<h4>Launch and land the kite with an assistant</h4>
					<p>To launch a kite safely you must first find the right angle
						to the wind.</p>
					<p>Starting from a downwind position, walk the bar and lines
						upwind until you reach 90 degrees to the wind. You should walk
						upwind to put tension in the kite until the kite stops flapping.
						Give the thumbs p signal to the assistant and slowly bring the
						kite up to 45 degrees. Check the kite reaction: make sure it is no
						shaking, over powered or moving back and forth. If something feels
						wrong, land the kite to your assistant. If you lose control of the
						kite or become overpowered, let go of the bar and pull the quick
						release.</p>
					<p>Just before you launch, look at your quick release to train
						your brain for a quick reaction in case of a problem.</p>
					<p>Avoid positioning the kite at the top of the window, because
						an updraft could lift you. Never launch a kite directly upwind or
						downwind to obstacles (rocks, trees, buildings, houses etc)</p>
