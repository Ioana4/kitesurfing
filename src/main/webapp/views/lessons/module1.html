						<h3>Module 1 - Discovery</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="content">
						<p>At this level you will learn and practice various skills on
							land that will transfer to the water for the next level. The
							skills covered include assessing the physical location and the
							wind window, using safety systems, managing proper equipment
							set-up, and piloting the trainer kite.</p>
						<p>Anyone can complete this level, provided they meet the
							health requirements.</p>
						<h4>Location</h4>
						<p>Almost all accidents occur on land, so before going out,
							you have to chose a safe place to launch and land the kite. Keep
							in mind the wind conditions (straight, directions and stability)
							and the physical layout of the spot (potential obstacles,
							presence of secure area to operate the kite). Assess hazards in
							the area – both in and off the water. Identify the obstacles that
							may affect the quality of the wind. Never practice alone and do
							not venture further than you comfortably swim back.</p>
						<h4>Wind</h4>
						<p>It is important to know the strength and the direction of
							the wind to ensure you use the right kite size. The speed meter
							and local forecast will help you taking the right decision.</p>
						<p>Wind Directions:</p>
						<ul>
						<li>On Shore – Wind coming from the water to the land square to
							the beach</li>
						<li>Off Shore – Wind coming from the land to the water square
							to the beach</li>
						<li>Side Shore – Wind blowing from the sea towards the land,
							slightly side on or side off</li>
						<li>Side On Shore – Wind blowing from the sea towards the land,
							slightly side on</li>
						<li>Side Off Shore – Wind blowing from the land to the sea,
							slightly side off</li>
						<li>Side Shore and side on shore are the safest wind directions
							for kiteboarding</li>
							</ul>

						<h4>Wind Effects</h4>
						<p>Obstacles can have a big effect on the wind, changing the
							flow enough to alter its direction or create turbulence. These
							effects can take place upwind, downwind or close to these
							obstacles.</p>
						<p>Take great care never to let you kite fly into these areas.</p>
						<h4>Weather</h4>
						<p>Before you kiteboard get a local forecast for the day and
							have the right equipment for the condition. Learn about the
							weather signs that you can see around you.</p>
						<p>The clouds are one of the best weather indicators around
							you. High-level clouds are cirrus clouds indicate that you are in
							a warm front or that one is approaching. This should mean stable
							weather and stable wind. If the clouds become fully established,
							then they will move into the midlevel and start to blanket out
							the sky. This could mean a grey and wet day if these clouds are
							dark and full of moisture.</p>
						<p>The clouds forming at the low levels (cumulus) can be very
							messy and it means that you are in a cold front or that there is
							one approaching. The wind is mostly unstable and could lead to
							gusty wind conditions or sudden changes as heavy rain showers.</p>
						<p>A cold front will start with low-level cumulus clouds that
							may then build up into the midlevel as the front establishes
							itself. This can lead to potentially stormy conditions, in
							certain cases to the formation of the cumulonimbus. This is
							characterized by its vertically developed shape and glaciated top
							that can extend to great heights of up to 12 km. As a
							cumulonimbus approaches, you will notice an increase in gusty
							winds and you may also feel the temperature drop. Usually once it
							has passed, the wind drops completely and the cloud disappears.</p>
						<p>If the sky is black, chances are the weather is going to
							change and there is going to be a storm. In this case land you
							kite and wait until the clouds have gone. This type of cloud can
							also signal the start of an electrical storm. The kite lines make
							an excellent conductors for lightning! Pack the kite away!</p>
						<p>Sea Breeze is a thermal wind, created by the sun heating
							the land, which in turn heats the air above. This warm air rises,
							creating a depression over the land. When this happens next to a
							body of cold water, the colder air from the sea moves in to fill
							the gap created by the rising warm air, which we feel as an
							on-shore wind. Sea breezes are generally very steady on-shore or
							cross-on-shore winds and can be great for kiteboarding. At the
							night, as the temperature drops, the whole process happens in
							reverse and the wind blows off shore (land breeze).</p>

						<h4>Right of Way</h4>
						<p>This is a long established sailing rule that applies to all
							forms of sailing, including kiteboarding. Respecting a few
							priority rules helps prevent accidents on the beach and on the
							water.</p>
						<p>The rider entering the water from the beach has the right
							of way over the incoming rider.</p>
						<p>Starboard rider has priority over oncoming rider and should
							keep the course and pass upwind with the kite higher.</p>
						<p>If you passing upwind, bring the kite UP. If you are
							passing downwind, bring your kite DOWN.</p>
						<p>When two riders are traveling in the same direction, the
							faster rider coming up from behind must give way to the slower
							rider in front.</p>
						<p>The rider surfing a wave has priority over the one who is
							jumping or going in the opposite direction</p>
						<p>Right of way must be given to other ocean and beach users.
							Kiteboarders must travel downwind to them.</p>
						<p>To jump, a rider must have a clear safety zone of 50m
							downwind and 30 m upwind.</p>
						<h4>Trainer kite</h4>
						<p>In a IKO kiteboarding course, your instructor will begin
							your training by teaching you to fly a trainer kite and a small
							inflatable kite without power, on a short lines. You will learn
							how to master the basics first before taking on additional power
							with long lines. Your instructor will teach you to set up the
							equipment correctly, launch and land, use the safety systems, and
							perfect all of the basic flying skills you need to know at this
							stage.</p>
						<p>Once you have learned the basics of flying a kite, you must
							to know how to stop the kite quickly in case of an emergency.</p>

						<h4>Set up and carrying the kite</h4>
						<p>The 2 lines located in the middle of the bar (front lines)
							must be connected to the leading edge bridle. These are the power
							lines. The other 2 lines located at the end of the bar (back
							lines) must be connected to the trailing edge bridle. These are
							the steering lines. Remember the phrase “Steer to the Rear” .</p>
						<p>There are two ways to set up your kite, with the bar and
							lines upwind and downwind, but all the time the colors have to
							match. Do not launch the kite with the bar inverted or crossed
							lines.</p>
						<p>Handling the kite properly is essential to your safety and
							to those around you. You will learn how to set up an inflatable
							kite with 2, 4 or 5 lines and its safety systems.</p>


						<h4>Safety System</h4>
						<p>You must let go of the bar and pull the quick release in
							any dangerous situation including:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Any time you lose control of your kite</li>
							<li>Whenever here is too much power</li>
							<li>If you are being dragged</li>
							<li>If you crash into another kite or object</li>
							<li>If you are going to crash into something or someone</li>
						</ul>

						<h4>International Kiteboarding Signs</h4>
						<p>Your instructor will use these signs to guide you when
							voice cannot be heard. Learning these signs and using them with
							other riders will allow you to use a common language and help
							avoid misinterpretation.</p>
						<p>‘ Ok to launch‘, ‘ Land my kite’, ‘Kite at top of the
							window’, ‘Superman position’, ‘Let go the bar’, ‘Release the
							chicken loop’, ‘Help’ are some of the signs you will learn.</p>

						<h4>Launch and land the kite with an assistant</h4>
						<p>To launch a kite safely you must first find the right angle
							to the wind.</p>
						<p>Starting from a downwind position, walk the bar and lines
							upwind until you reach 90 degrees to the wind. You should walk
							upwind to put tension in the kite until the kite stops flapping.
							Give the thumbs p signal to the assistant and slowly bring the
							kite up to 45 degrees. Check the kite reaction: make sure it is
							no shaking, over powered or moving back and forth. If something
							feels wrong, land the kite to your assistant. If you lose control
							of the kite or become overpowered, let go of the bar and pull the
							quick release.</p>
						<p>Just before you launch, look at your quick release to train
							your brain for a quick reaction in case of a problem.</p>
						<p>Avoid positioning the kite at the top of the window,
							because an updraft could lift you. Never launch a kite directly
							upwind or downwind to obstacles (rocks, trees, buildings, houses
							etc)</p>
